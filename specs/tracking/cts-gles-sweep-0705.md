# CTS GLES sweep 2026-07-05 (Linux Mesa, llvmpipe + crocus) — findings

Status: **root-caused; fixes pending handoff**. First CTS run against the
Tier 2 GLES backend, on the Linux host (Haswell). Backend forced via
`CTS_YAWGPU_BACKEND=gles` (already supported by webgpu-native-cts's
yawgpu shim); library `target-gles/release` built with
`--features vulkan,gles`. Driver profiles on this host: **crocus**
(Haswell iGPU, ES 3.1 floor) and **llvmpipe**
(`LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1`, ES 3.2, no GPU-wedge risk).

## Timeline / incidents

- 18:33 `--workers 4` crocus full sweep (`webgpu:*`): whole-machine
  hard stop at ~18:36 (journal cuts off, no i915 errors, no clean
  shutdown). Initially suspected thermal (intel_powerclamp lines) —
  **ruled out**: powerclamp cycling is chronic on this host (228
  events in a benign same-day boot that shut down cleanly) and the
  user observed no fan spin-up. Workers had already crash-resumed
  (`--shard-from ~347-350`) before the freeze.
- llvmpipe re-runs reproduced the worker crash deterministically:
  abort after exactly 107 `create_egl_device` calls, independent of
  `ulimit -v` (8 GiB) and `ulimit -n` (4096). Byte-identical logs
  across runs.
- `EGL_LOG_LEVEL=debug` pinpointed the failing call:
  `EGL user error 0x3001 (EGL_NOT_INITIALIZED) in eglChooseConfig`.
- Control experiments (raw EGL loop, llvmpipe): 200 clean
  create/destroy context cycles OK; 200 *leaked* contexts also OK —
  no Mesa-side context-count limit. The failure is yawgpu-side.

## Finding G-1 — `wgpuInstanceRequestAdapter` panics (abort) on empty enumeration

`yawgpu/src/ffi/instance.rs:337`:
`.expect("Noop instance must expose an adapter")` fires when
`enumerate_adapters_with_feature_level` returns an empty list. The
message betrays the Noop-era assumption; for real backends an empty
list is a legitimate spec-level outcome ("no adapter available") and
must be delivered as a `RequestAdapter` callback with a non-success
status and null adapter, not a panic. Panicking across the
`extern "C"` boundary in the cdylib aborts the process
(`fatal runtime error: failed to initiate panic`). This is the direct
crash: every CTS worker crash-resume traces to this expect.
CLAUDE.md core principle 3's FFI `expect` exception covers invalid
handles/null, **not** this condition.

## Finding G-2 — `EglInstanceState::Drop` calls `eglTerminate` on a process-global display (root cause)

`yawgpu-hal/src/gles/instance.rs:35`. EGL display handles are
process-global: `eglGetDisplay(EGL_DEFAULT_DISPLAY)` returns the same
display to every caller in the process. When the CTS harness overlaps
instance lifetimes (new instance initialized before the old one is
released), the old instance's Drop terminates the display **under the
live instance**, and every subsequent EGL call on it fails
(`EGL_NOT_INITIALIZED`) → `enumerate_adapters` returns empty → G-1
aborts the process. Live GL contexts on a terminated display are also
undefined behaviour at the driver level — the leading suspect for the
18:36 whole-machine freeze on crocus/i915 (4 workers × churning
contexts on real hardware), though that attribution is plausible, not
proven. Precedent: wgpu-hal deliberately never calls `eglTerminate`
for exactly this reason.

## Finding G-3 (minor) — `enumerate_adapters` silently maps EGL errors to an empty list

`yawgpu-hal/src/gles/instance.rs:75-77`: `choose_config` failure →
`unwrap_or_default()` with no diagnostic, unlike every other GLES
bring-up failure path (which `eprintln!`s). Made G-2 needlessly hard
to localize: the process died with zero GLES diagnostics.

## Fix plan (handoff T-G1..T-G3)

- **T-G1**: empty enumeration in `wgpuInstanceRequestAdapter` →
  register the callback with an unavailable/error status and null
  adapter per webgpu.h semantics; never `expect`. Inline unit test.
- **T-G2**: stop terminating the display in `EglInstanceState::Drop`
  (leak-by-design, wgpu-hal precedent), with a comment documenting the
  process-global display semantics. Inline unit test:
  two overlapping `GlesInstance` lifetimes, drop the first, the
  second must still enumerate (feature-gated e2e-style unit test that
  self-skips when EGL is unavailable).
- **T-G3**: log the EGL error on the `choose_config` failure path in
  `enumerate_adapters`.

## Verification once fixed

1. Repro (must run clean end-to-end, no abort):
   `CTS_YAWGPU_BACKEND=gles LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 ./build-yawgpu-release/cts 'webgpu:api,operation,buffers,*' 'webgpu:api,operation,command_buffer,*'`
2. llvmpipe chunked full sweep (transcripts/gles-sweep-llvmpipe.sh).
3. crocus real-GPU sweep, supervised, quarantining the two zero-dim
   indirect-dispatch files (permanent quarantine per the 0704 sweep
   doc — same Haswell hardware wedge applies to
   `glDispatchComputeIndirect`).

## Operational notes (this host)

- CTS sweep worker count: the machine sustains `--workers 2`
  (~92 °C package, powerclamp-managed); `--workers 4` is untested
  post-fix and was in flight during the freeze — prefer ≤2 until the
  fixed library survives a full llvmpipe sweep.
- The docs/06-build-and-run.md example query
  `webgpu:api,validation,createBuffer:*` no longer matches the
  catalog (`webgpu:api,validation,buffer,create:*` is current) —
  runner silently reports pass=0 for unmatched queries (cts-repo docs
  fix candidate).

## Finding G-4 — self-deadlock in GLES `ResolveQuerySet` submission (2026-07-05 evening)

Repro (hangs forever, single case):
`CTS_YAWGPU_BACKEND=gles cts 'webgpu:api,validation,encoding,queries,resolveQuerySet:queryset_and_destination_buffer_state:querySetState="valid";destinationState="valid"'`
— the only case of the file that executes a real resolve; the other 8
(error-path) cases pass. Bisected from the full api,validation chunk
stalling at any worker count.

Cause: `submit_copies` (yawgpu-hal/src/gles/queue.rs, `ResolveQuerySet`
arm) calls `resolve.destination.write(...)` **inside**
`with_current_context`, and `GlesBuffer::write`
(yawgpu-hal/src/gles/buffer.rs:77) re-acquires the same device
`current_lock` — parking_lot mutexes are non-reentrant, so the queue
thread self-deadlocks. Every submission containing a resolveQuerySet
hangs the device permanently; this is also what stalled the 21:08
`--workers 4` crocus sweep (workers block one by one as their shard
reaches this file — worker count is irrelevant).

Fix (T-G4): perform the destination write with the already-current `gl`
inside the held lock (factor a lock-free `write_with_gl(gl, offset,
data)` helper out of `GlesBuffer::write` and use it from both call
sites), or hoist the resolve write outside the context closure. Inline
unit test: a submit containing a ResolveQuerySet copy against a real
GLES device must complete (self-skip when EGL unavailable) — a plain
Noop-level test cannot catch the re-entrancy.

## api,validation fail clusters observed during bisect (crocus, workers=2, to triage after G-4)

- files compute_pipeline..encoding,queries,general (bisect A1): fail=12,542 (pass=55,021 skip=104,379)
- image_copy,{buffer_related,buffer_texture_copies,layout_related}: fail=375+38+2,612
- error_scope: fail=12; buffer,*+capability_checks,*: fail=75

## Latent hazard noted during the T-G4 re-entrancy audit (not fixed; no current path triggers it)

The `Drop` impls of `GlesBufferInner` (buffer.rs:20), the
`GlesRenderPipeline`/`GlesComputePipeline` inners (pipeline.rs:36, 113),
`GlesSampler` (sampler.rs:21) and `GlesTexture` (texture.rs:30) each
acquire `with_current_context`. If the last `Arc` of any of these were
dropped from inside a context closure, the same self-deadlock as G-4
would occur. No production path currently does this (`submit_copies`
only borrows from `&[HalCopy]`), but any future change that moves owned
HAL resources into the submit path must keep this in mind.

## Finding G-5 — draw path rejects vertex buffers bound at slots the pipeline does not use

`bind_vertex_buffers` (yawgpu-hal/src/gles/queue.rs:1121-1130) iterates
`pass.vertex_buffers` and returns `HalError` ("vertex buffer binding is
missing from pipeline layout") when a bound slot has no layout entry in
the pipeline. WebGPU semantics: vertex buffers bound beyond the
pipeline's declared layouts are simply ignored at draw time (the CTS
draw suite binds buffers at extra slots constantly). Largest single
api,validation fail cluster: 11,988. Fix (T-G5): `continue` instead of
erroring for slots with no pipeline layout entry.

## Finding G-6 — Mesa rejects fragment-less render program links (ANGLE accepted them)

638+18 fails: "GLES render program link failed: error: program lacks a
fragment shader" (vertex-only pipelines, e.g. layout_shader_compat).
The mapping matrix noted vertex-only pipelines work "where GLES program
linking accepts a fragment-less program" — ANGLE accepts, Mesa/crocus
does not (GLSL ES requires both stages). Fix (T-G6): when a render
pipeline has no fragment stage, attach a minimal fragment shader
(`#version 310 es\nvoid main() {}`) at link time so vertex-only
pipelines link on every driver.

## Remaining api,validation clusters (larger slices, separate handoffs)

- Color-target formats beyond RGBA8/BGRA8 (5,083) — widen the
  renderable-format table per GLES 3.1 (+EXT_color_buffer_float);
  needs glClearBuffer{f,i,ui}v for integer formats.
- 1D/3D/array texture copies (3,594 + 311 T2B framebuffer-incomplete +
  257 format-unsupported) — P15.3 deferral.
- MRT >1 color target (1,270 + 44 + 34 sparse/non-zero slot) — F-040
  slice 1 deferral; GLES 3.1 glDrawBuffers.
- Unorm8x4Bgra vertex format (364) — no ES equivalent; candidate for
  permanent Tier-2 catalogue (Dawn emulates via shader swizzle).
- rgba8unorm read-write storage (180) — core-level message; verify
  against spec tiering before touching (may be correct behaviour).

## Overnight fix session 2026-07-05/06 — api,validation ledger (crocus, workers=2)

| Slice | Commit | fail after |
|---|---|---|
| start of session | 82de24f (G-4) | 24,553 |
| G-5 ignore undeclared VB slots + G-6 stub fragment shader | a975951 | 13,052 |
| T-G7 GLES 3.1 color-renderable set + integer clears | 12aefe9 | — |
| T-G8 MRT via glDrawBuffers (uniform per-target state) | d43b5bf | 7,531 |
| T-G11 base-vertex draws (OES/EXT_draw_elements_base_vertex) | fad5a01 | — |
| T-G9 2D-array/3D copies (+ Mesa 3D-layer PBO readback bug workaround) | 2139a0f | 3,759 |
| T-G12 extension-gated float color targets | 5d0e244 | **2,616** |

pass 185,492 → 207,429; crash 0 throughout; draw file 12,006 → 56.

## Remaining clusters (2,616) — classification

Permanent Tier-2 catalogue candidates (need sign-off, then CTS
expectations entries):
- 852 residual non-renderable color targets (snorm / bgra8unorm-srgb /
  formats GLES cannot render to even with extensions — enumerate before
  sign-off)
- 364 Unorm8x4Bgra vertex format (no ES equivalent; Dawn emulates via
  shader swizzle — implementable but costly)

Policy decision needed (adapter limits truthfulness vs binding remap):
- 330+330 shader compile fails: `layout(binding=999)` exceeds GL UBO
  limits (adapter advertises WebGPU-default maxBindingsPerBindGroup),
  `samplerCubeArray` reserved on ES 3.1 (cube-array needs ES 3.2/EXT).
  Options: report真 GLES limits on the adapter (sub-WebGPU-minimum) or
  implement the block-67 linear binding remap for group/binding.
- 180 "unsupported read-write storage texture format" (core-level
  message — verify against spec tiering first).
- 32 "supports only bind group 0" (render 16 + compute 16) — the
  full bind-group remap design (same thread as above).

Small implementables:
- 54 indexed-indirect index-buffer offset restriction
- 17 framebuffer-incomplete T2B residuals
- 373 "texture format not supported (P15.3)" — mostly depth/stencil
  copy formats; depth readback needs blit tricks on ES (part catalog,
  part implementable)

Next feature slice: F-040 slice 2 MSAA/resolve (41 direct fails here,
larger effect expected in api,operation).

## api,operation sweep (2026-07-06 morning, crocus, workers=2, per-dir)

Totals: ~76,000 fail / crash 0. command_buffer needed ~8.5 min alone
(slow, not stalled). Clusters:

- **command_buffer 72,031** — three families: (1) T2B "texture padding
  mismatch ... got 0" (~12k+): readback zeroes destination-buffer
  padding bytes the CTS expects preserved; (2) "framebuffer incomplete
  for texture-to-buffer copy" 3,848: T2B of non-color-renderable
  formats cannot use the FBO/glReadPixels path; (3) large pixel-mismatch
  families in image_copy origins/extents/array cases (real copy bugs).
- **render_pipeline 3,029** — nearly all "queue submit cannot use an
  error command buffer": encode-time HAL rejection poisons the CB; the
  dominant underlying rejection is the catalogued-but-unimplemented
  **texture/sampler bindings in render/compute passes** (also 60 direct
  hits in texture_view). Implementing GLES texture/sampler binding is
  the single biggest unlock for api,operation and shader,execution.
- rendering 427 (334 P15.3 formats, 72 indexed-indirect offset),
  memory_sync 234 (166+64 "binding size exceeds GLES limit"),
  texture_view 210, render_pass 63, others < 30 each.

## Agreed next campaign (user-approved 2026-07-06 morning; in this order)

1. **T-G13 — sampled texture + sampler bindings** (render + compute,
   group 0, storage textures stay rejected → T-G14). Key unlock for
   api,operation and the untouched shader,execution area. Investigate
   Tint's combined-sampler GLSL emission first (yawgpu-tint BindingRemap
   plumbing exists); assign texture units at link time (tint_immediates
   uniform pattern), bind via glActiveTexture/glBindTexture/glBindSampler
   at draw/dispatch; mip subrange via TEXTURE_BASE_LEVEL/MAX_LEVEL;
   array-layer-subrange views and cube-array return HalError. A stopped
   agent had just started this — restart fresh.
2. T2B padding-zeroing bug (~12k in command_buffer) + copy-correctness
   families (image_copy origins/extents).
3. Decision 2a implementation: adapter reports true GLES limits
   (maxBindingsPerBindGroup et al from GL queries) and stops advertising
   norm16/texture-formats-tier features it cannot render.
4. T2B of non-color-renderable formats (3,848).
5. Tier-2 permanent catalogue (user-approved): snorm/16-bit-norm/
   bgra8unorm-srgb render targets, Unorm8x4Bgra vertex format →
   block-67 matrix entries + webgpu-native-cts expectations file.

Verification loop per slice: unit gates → target-gles release rebuild →
targeted CTS file(s) → full-area re-measure → commit. CTS runs:
workers=2, one GPU process at a time, never stack GPU loads
(see memory: no-heavy-load-on-this-host).

## 2026-07-06 Codex-agent session: MSAA + the sample_mask onion (T-G15..T-G18)

Landed in one interleaved change set (commit below):
- T-G15 MSAA: glTexStorage2DMultisample textures, MSAA passes,
  glBlitFramebuffer resolve, glSampleMaski sample mask,
  alpha-to-coverage; real-EGL resolve/mask tests.
- T-G16 diagnosability: CommandBuffer/BindGroup/TextureView retain
  their creation/finish error message; submit and setBindGroup errors
  append it ("...: <original>"). This peeled a 4-layer error onion that
  was previously a single opaque "error command buffer" (CTS harness
  keeps only the LAST uncaptured error — harness.cpp:349).
- T-G17: Tint texture_builtins_from_uniform metadata UBO exposed
  through the shim and bound by GLES pipelines (textureLoad with
  explicit binding remaps previously failed pipeline creation with
  Codegen("texture missing from texture_builtins_from_uniform list")).
- T-G18: depth/stencil format mappings (depth16..depth32f-stencil8,
  stencil8 gated on OES_texture_stencil8), DEPTH_STENCIL_TEXTURE_MODE
  aspect binding, and a per-device internal NEAREST placeholder
  sampler — placeholder (samplerless textureLoad) bindings previously
  left default LINEAR filtering on integer/stencil textures, making
  them incomplete (reads returned 0; llvmpipe confirmed it was not a
  driver quirk).

CTS render_pipeline dir: pass 36 -> 366, fail 3,029 -> 2,699 (rest is
MSAA per-sample behavioural correctness in the huge sample_mask file).
Next: rerun full api,validation + api,operation ledgers, then the
remaining campaign order stands.

## Ledger update after T-G15..T-G18 (2026-07-06)

- api,validation: fail 2,616 -> **2,280** (pass 207,765; crash 0).
- api,operation command_buffer: 72,031 -> 72,844 (slightly up: depth
  formats now create, exposing more copy cases to the known T2B
  bugs — the untouched campaign slice #2).
- render_pipeline: 3,029 -> 2,699 (rest: MSAA per-sample behaviour in
  sample_mask).

Next session: campaign slice #2 (T2B padding-zeroing + copy
correctness, ~12k+ single-bug candidates in command_buffer), then
limits truthfulness (#3), non-renderable readback (#4), catalogue (#5).
Codex-agent ops note: Codex sandbox has no EGL — hardware verification
always runs on the orchestrator side; the hypothesis->instrument->
hardware-output loop works well.

## Slice 2 progress (2026-07-06, Codex agent)

- 2a (b20ff6c): T2B padding preservation — command_buffer 72,844 -> 60,354.
- 2b (80eef90): ClearTexture lazy-init was a GLES no-op + sampled-bind
  BASE/MAX_LEVEL poisoning of later copies — 60,354 -> **37,669**.
- Remaining command_buffer clusters: non-renderable-format T2B
  (framebuffer-incomplete, 3,848 — slice #4), depth readback rejection
  (1,196 — slice #4/catalogue), and a ~30k pixel-mismatch tail to
  re-cluster after slice #4 (many were secondary to the fixed bugs).
- Campaign slices #3 (limits truthfulness) and #5 (catalogue) unchanged.

## Slice 4 (2026-07-06): compute-shader T2B fallback landed

command_buffer 37,669 -> **22,739** (snorm/norm16 + depth-aspect
readbacks now work; stencil readback stays catalogued). Session
command_buffer total: 72,844 -> 22,739. Remaining: re-cluster the
~22k tail (T2T format-conversion families suspected), then slices
#3 (limits truthfulness) and #5 (catalogue).

## Slice 4b exploration (2026-07-06 late) — REVERTED, findings kept

Attempted: rgb9e5ufloat compute-fallback + PBO->client-row readback
rewrite + OES_copy_image detection. Unit-level copy matrix (formats x
offsets x origins x layers) went fully green, but CTS command_buffer
regressed (22,739 -> 23,850 -> 24,116), so the working tree was
reverted to 661991a per the beat-the-checkpoint rule. Salvageable
pieces saved in webgpu-native-cts/transcripts/
slice4b-exploration-reverted.patch: (1) the comprehensive matrix test,
(2) canonical Rust RGB9E5 reference encoder (layout R 0..8, G 9..17,
B 18..26, exp 27..31), (3) GL_OES_copy_image detection. Lesson: the
client-row readback rewrite likely regressed cases the matrix does not
cover (3D, mips, T2T interactions) — next attempt should change ONE
path at a time and re-run CTS per change. Checkpoint stands at
command_buffer fail=22,739 (commit 5736aea/661991a).

## Slice 4b pieces (2026-07-06 night, one-at-a-time discipline)

- Piece 1 (eb9f172): rgb9e5 compute fallback + copy matrix test — 22,739 -> 22,503.
- Piece 2 (a602bc7): GL_OES_copy_image detection — -> 22,434.
- Piece 3 (7f08953): non-attachable lazy-init clear via zero upload — -> **19,331** (fb-incomplete family eliminated).
- Piece 4 REVERTED (patch: webgpu-native-cts/transcripts/slice4b-piece4-3d-b2t-reverted.patch): 3D B2T row-by-row upload regressed CTS to 20,968 despite green matrix incl. the new 4x4x3 partial-B2T case. The "byte 48 expected 0 got 1" family (~3.5k, r8snorm/3d origins_and_extents) remains UNSOLVED — the failing shape differs from all matrix cases; next attempt should extract the exact CTS subcase parameters (--list-cases on that test) and replicate one verbatim before changing production code.
- Remaining command_buffer: 19,331 = unsolved padding family (~3.5k) + stencil readback catalogue (908) + long tail to re-cluster.

## Slice 4b piece 5 WIP (paused mid-investigation; patch saved)

The r8snorm/3d rows_per_image>height family is REPRODUCED by an
exhaustive CTS-replica unit test (in
webgpu-native-cts/transcripts/slice4b-piece5-slicestride-wip.patch,
together with a per-slice B2T upload attempt that did NOT fix it —
CTS 19,331 -> 19,373, replica still failing identically). Open
question for the resumption: the replica reports "byte 32 expected 63"
inside ROW PADDING for a width-3 texture at read_bpr=256 — byte 32
cannot be texel data at that stride, so the replica's own
expected-buffer stride math is suspect; verify the checker semantics
in webgpu-native-cts harness.cpp:601-646 before trusting the repro,
THEN re-attempt the production fix. Committed checkpoint remains
command_buffer fail=19,331 (repo green, 156 gles tests).

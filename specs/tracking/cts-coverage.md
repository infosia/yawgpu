# CTS coverage ledger — `api/validation`

Live status of porting the WebGPU CTS (`gpuweb/cts`,
`src/webgpu/api/validation/`) onto the yawgpu C FFI. Methodology,
exclusions, harness contract, directory layout, and the `$CTS`
checkout-path convention: `specs/blocks/91-cts-conformance.md`.

This ledger is at **spec-file granularity** (129 rows). The per-`g.test()`
checklist for an area lives in that area's Phase-B task handoff; this
table is the master index of which areas are done vs untouched.

**The CTS port is counted independently of the legacy Dawn tests.** A
spec is `ported` once every non-excluded `g.test()` has its own Rust
`#[test]` under `tests/cts/validation/…`, **regardless of whether a
legacy `yawgpu/tests/*.rs` already exercises the same rule** —
duplication across the two layers is allowed. There is therefore no
"partially covered by legacy" state: a spec is `todo` until its CTS
cases are ported, then `ported`.

## Status legend

| status | meaning |
|---|---|
| `ported` | every non-excluded `g.test()` has a Rust `#[test]` under `tests/cts/validation/…`, green on Noop |
| `ported*` | as `ported`, but some subcases were excluded or `#[ignore]`d (web-only, or deferred behind a core gap with a spec-correct assertion) — reason in-row |
| `todo` | not yet ported to `tests/cts/` (a legacy Dawn test may still overlap — see related-test column) |
| `N/A` | excluded (web/canvas/WebCodecs/IDL/empty); reason in-row |

The **related legacy test** column is *informational only*: the legacy
`yawgpu/tests/*.rs` (Dawn-ported) file that overlaps this CTS spec, kept
as a pointer to prior art a porter may consult for the Rust idiom. It is
never a reason to skip a CTS case.

## Snapshot

- 129 spec files / 704 `g.test()` cases total in `api/validation`.
- Excluded (`N/A`): 7 whole spec files (web/empty/multiDraw + setImmediates/immediate absent).
- `ported`: 122 (all non-`N/A` specs). **The `api/validation` CTS port
  is COMPLETE** — every non-excluded `g.test()` across all 129 spec files
  has a Rust `#[test]` under `tests/cts/validation/…`. Many `ported*`
  with subcases `#[ignore]`d behind core gaps (real spec-correct bodies)
  or feature-gated on Noop — see rows and the core-gap list below.
- `todo`: 0.
- **Phase E (legacy cleanup) — partial.** 8 legacy Dawn test files whose
  rules are fully covered by *active* CTS tests were deleted:
  `buffer_creation_validation`, `buffer_map_validation`,
  `buffer_mapped_range_validation`, `debug_marker_validation`,
  `queue_submit_validation`, `texture_creation_validation`,
  `texture_view_validation`, `vertex_state_validation` (66 redundant
  tests). The remaining ~22 legacy `*_validation.rs` were **kept**: each
  has at least one active rule that the CTS port currently only
  `#[ignore]`s (a core gap) or covers more broadly — deleting them would
  drop live coverage. **That kept-list is the worklist for the core-gap
  follow-up phase** (close the gap in core → un-ignore the CTS test →
  then delete the legacy test). KEEP-forever (no CTS analog):
  future_modes, gles_context_backend_chain, instance_smoke,
  label_validation, multiple_device_validation, object_caching_validation,
  pipeline_async_validation, surface_validation, unsafe_api_validation.
- **Core-gap follow-up #1 (device-ownership) — DONE.** yawgpu now
  validates resource owner-device at the record-time FFI entry points
  (createBindGroup BGL; begin{Render,Compute}Pass attachments/query-sets;
  resolveQuerySet; clearBuffer; copyTextureToTexture; indirect
  dispatch/draw; render-bundle setPipeline/BindGroup/Vertex/IndexBuffer).
  15 device-mismatch CTS tests un-ignored → active & passing. (Per-row
  "device-mismatch ignored" sub-notes below are superseded for these.)
- **Core-gap follow-up #2 (feature-aware format caps) — DONE.** Added
  `Feature` variants (BC/ETC2/ASTC[+sliced-3d] compression,
  depth32float-stencil8, bgra8unorm-storage, float32-filterable) + FFI
  mapping; Noop advertises them; `TextureFormat::caps` is now feature-keyed
  and threaded through all texture/view/BGL/pipeline/pass/bundle/queue/copy
  validation (via `Texture::format_caps()` using stored device features).
  ~15 format-feature CTS tests un-ignored → active & passing
  (`capability_checks/features/texture_formats{,_tier1,_tier2}`,
  `texture/{bgra8unorm_storage,float32_filterable,rg11b10ufloat_renderable}`);
  only canvas/surface fixture subcases remain ignored. Regressions in
  compressed-format tests/e2e updated to request the feature.
- **Core-gap follow-up #3 (Batch B, create-time validation) — DONE.**
  +38 CTS tests un-ignored → active: compute pipeline-override evaluation
  (naga `process_overrides` → workgroup size/storage/arithmetic);
  render-pipeline inter-stage matching (all 8: location/type/interpolation/
  maxInterStageShaderVariables); fragment color/blend (maxColorAttachments,
  bytes-per-sample, blend-factor, writeMask, vec4 source-alpha);
  depth-stencil `depthCompare=always` inert handling (6); device-limit
  relationship validation (~16: invocations vs workgroup,
  maxBindGroupsPlusVertexBuffers, min*Alignment pow2/≥32, binding-size vs
  maxBufferSize, etc.). Still deferred → Batch C: layout/resource
  compatibility matrices, dual-source-blending/shader-f16 (feature adds),
  bytes-per-sample format-selection matrices, draw-time relationship.
- **Core-gap follow-up #4 (Batch C, layout/resource compat + misc) — DONE.**
  +30 CTS un-ignored (152→122 remaining): BGL validation (vertex-stage
  writable-storage rejection, multisample float sampleType, cube storage
  dimension, rw-storage format), pipeline-layout (immediateSize %4,
  cross-BGL dynamic + per-stage aggregation), bind-group (destroyed
  resources, effective-size %4, sampler compare-vs-type, component class,
  storage mip/format), getBindGroupLayout (empty default for unused
  in-range slot), compute/render resource compatibility, non-filterable
  gather, query count==0. Also fixed a real bug: explicit pipeline-layout
  cache keys now use core Arc identity (not transient FFI handle address).
  Deferred → Batch D: render-pass/bundle attachment-misc matrices,
  resource_usages subresource granularity, destroyed-resource timing.
- **Core-gap follow-up #5 (Batch D, encoder/command rules) — DONE.**
  +8 CTS un-ignored (122→114): setBindGroup eager validation (index <
  maxBindGroups, dynamic-offset count/alignment/range, error bind group —
  closes the long-standing setBindGroup-deferred gap), setPipeline rejects
  error pipelines immediately (render + compute), setViewport/setScissorRect
  bounds validation. Fixed dynamic-offset range semantics
  (binding_offset+dynamic_offset+binding_size ≤ buffer.size).
  **Still deferred (each a larger model change, "close all gaps" residue):**
  Cluster 1 render-pass/bundle attachment-misc (needs attachment-signature/
  descriptor model expansion: depthSlice 3D, mip-level-count,
  depthReadOnly/stencilReadOnly, resolve-format, transient, pass↔pipeline
  compat); Cluster 3 resource-usage subresource granularity (fine-grained
  mip/layer/aspect usage-scope tracking); Cluster 4 destroyed-resource
  finish→submit timing (behavior change). Plus feature-adds + native-surface
  + a few C-ABI-N/A (u32array start/length, scissor negative args,
  maxDrawCount, vertex-OOB lastStride).
- **Core-gap follow-up #6 (Cluster 1, render-pass attachment-misc) — DONE.**
  +22 CTS un-ignored (114→92); **`render_pass/` now 0 ignores (fully
  active)**. Expanded attachment model: `RenderPassColorAttachment.depth_slice`,
  `RenderPassDepthStencilAttachment.depth_read_only/stencil_read_only`,
  `AttachmentSignature` readonly state (+ FFI conv). New validation:
  3D-color depthSlice (definedness/bounds/overlap), attachment+resolve
  mip-level-count==1, depthReadOnly/stencilReadOnly loadOp/storeOp match,
  resolve-format-support, transient load/store, render-pass↔pipeline
  attachment compat (color/depth/sample + readonly write-state),
  createRenderBundleEncoder bytes-per-sample, storage_texture format.
  Remaining closeable → Cluster 3 (resource-usage subresource
  granularity) + Cluster 4 (destroyed-resource finish→submit timing).
- Known core gaps surfaced (recommended follow-up): evaluate
  pipeline-overridable constants at createComputePipeline (workgroup-size
  / storage-size limits + override-expression errors); **inter-stage
  vertex-output↔fragment-input matching** (location/type/interpolation/
  max-variables — currently unvalidated, 8/9 inter_stage cases ignored);
  pipeline-layout/shader resource compatibility (createComputePipeline +
  createRenderPipeline); depth-clip-control gating of unclippedDepth;
  storage-texture format/access in render auto-layout.

## Regenerating this matrix

The case counts come straight from the CTS checkout. To refresh after a
CTS pull (counts only — the mapping / status / exclusion columns are
hand-maintained), point `CTS` at your local `gpuweb/cts` checkout root:

```sh
python3 - "$CTS" <<'PY'
import re, glob, sys
root=sys.argv[1]+"/src/webgpu/api/validation"
for f in sorted(glob.glob(root+"/**/*.spec.ts", recursive=True)):
    rel=f[len(root)+1:]
    n=len(re.findall(r"g\.test\(\s*[`'\"]([^`'\"]+)", open(f,encoding="utf-8",errors="replace").read()))
    print(f"{n:3d}  {rel}")
PY
